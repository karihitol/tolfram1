									<p>The point of this project is to familiarize myself with web development. I can then use this website as a portfolio for all the projects worked on for VEL608G. In short, this entire project is the website and how I made it.</p>
									<p>The first step was downloading brackets, the code editor I used to create this website. Having no knowledge in html I followed the teacher's recommendation. I went on to download a template from https://html5up.net/ . The template I chose is called Forty https://html5up.net/forty . I was mainly attracted to the color, and the simplicity, it seemed to fit my needs. I copied the template into brackets and tried out the live preview to see what it looked like. After that I immediately started to make the changes for my personnal portfolio. I had to delete a few elements from the template such as a "Log in" button, being very careful because I wasn't sure of what each line of code does. More than once did everything on the front page disappear in the Menu bar on the right as I was trying to remove it.</p>
									<p>After writing a bit about myself, I started this very page, writing about what I had done. What's left to do at this point is sign up to Github and see how I can uplaod this site. I created an account and went on to create a new repository.</p>
